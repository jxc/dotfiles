Forked from https://github.com/holman/dotfiles, borrows heavily from https://github.com/caarlos0/dotfiles

## dotfiles

Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

## Installation

### Dependencies

First, make sure you have all those things installed:

- `git`: to clone the repo
- `curl`: to download some stuff
- `tar`: to extract downloaded stuff
- `zsh`: to actually run the dotfiles
- `sudo`: some configs may need that

### Install

Then, run these steps:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/tylerwolf/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ ./script/bootstrap
$ zsh # or just close and open your terminal again.
```

> All changed files will be backed up with a `.backup` suffix.

### macOS defaults

You use it by running:

```console
$DOTFILES/macos/set-defaults.sh
```

And logging out and in again/restart.

## topical

Everything's built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to your
forked dotfiles — say, "Java" — you can simply add a `java` directory and put
files in there. Anything with an extension of `.zsh` will get automatically
included into your shell. Anything with an extension of `.symlink` will get
symlinked without extension into `$HOME` when you run `script/bootstrap`.

## components

There's a few special files in the hierarchy.

- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made
  available everywhere.
- **topic/\*.zsh**: Any files ending in `.zsh` get loaded into your
  environment.
- **topic/path.zsh**: Any file named `path.zsh` is loaded first and is
  expected to setup `$PATH` or similar.
- **topic/completion.zsh**: Any file named `completion.zsh` is loaded
  last and is expected to setup autocomplete.
- **topic/\*.symlink**: Any files ending in `*.symlink` get symlinked into
  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles
  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get
  symlinked in when you run `script/bootstrap`.
